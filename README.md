# Favicon

There is a default favicon with this theme, you may want to change it. Just put it at `themes/hugo-fabric/static/images/fav.ico`.

# Code highlight

If you want to change to your favourite highlight style, just download the css file and replace `themes/hugo-fabric/static/css/hljs.css`. Since all languages package are too big, the CDN version only include 23 languages support. If you want more languages, please download a custome version of highlightjs and modify `layouts/partials/head.html`.

# Archive support

```
type = "archives"
```
